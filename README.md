InstantStyle is a general framework that employs two straightforward yet potent techniques for achieving an effective disentanglement of style and content from reference images.

Note: This fork is experimental - mainly exploring using multiple weighted images to supply style info.

## Principle

Separating Content from Image. Benefit from the good characterization of CLIP global features, after subtracting the content text fea- tures from the image features, the style and content can be explicitly decoupled. Although simple, this strategy is quite effective in mitigating content leakage.

Injecting into Style Blocks Only. Empirically, each layer of a deep network captures different semantic information the key observation in our work is that there exists two specific attention layers handling style. Specifically, we find up blocks.0.attentions.1 and down blocks.2.attentions.1 capture style (color, material, atmosphere) and spatial layout (structure, composition) respectively.

## Download
Follow [IP-Adapter](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter?tab=readme-ov-file#download-models) to download pre-trained checkpoints from [here](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter).

```
git clone https://github.com/InstantStyle/InstantStyle.git
cd InstantStyle

# download the models
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter
mv IP-Adapter/models models
mv IP-Adapter/sdxl_models sdxl_models
```

## Usage

Our method is fully compatible with [IP-Adapter](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter). For feature subtraction, it only works for global feature instead of patch features. For SD1.5, you can find a demo at [infer_style_sd15.py](https://github.com/InstantStyle/InstantStyle/blob/main/infer_style_sd15.py), but we find that SD1.5 has weaker perception and understanding of style information, thus this demo is experimental only. All block names can be found in [attn_blocks.py](https://github.com/InstantStyle/InstantStyle/blob/main/attn_blocks.py) and [attn_blocks_sd15.py](https://github.com/InstantStyle/InstantStyle/blob/main/attn_blocks_sd15.py) for SDXL and SD1.5 respectively.

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline
from PIL import Image

from ip_adapter import IPAdapterXL

base_model_path = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
image_encoder_path = "sdxl_models/image_encoder"
ip_ckpt = "sdxl_models/ip-adapter_sdxl.bin"
device = "cuda"

# load SDXL pipeline
pipe = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(
    base_model_path,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    add_watermarker=False,
)

# reduce memory consumption
pipe.enable_vae_tiling()

# load ip-adapter
# target_blocks=["block"] for original IP-Adapter
# target_blocks=["up_blocks.0.attentions.1"] for style blocks only
# target_blocks = ["up_blocks.0.attentions.1", "down_blocks.2.attentions.1"] # for style+layout blocks
ip_model = IPAdapterXL(pipe, image_encoder_path, ip_ckpt, device, target_blocks=["up_blocks.0.attentions.1"])

image = "./assets/0.jpg"
image = Image.open(image)
image.resize((512, 512))

# generate image variations with only image prompt
images = ip_model.generate(pil_image=image,
                            prompt="a cat, masterpiece, best quality, high quality",
                            negative_prompt= "text, watermark, lowres, low quality, worst quality, deformed, glitch, low contrast, noisy, saturation, blurry",
                            scale=1.0,
                            guidance_scale=5,
                            num_samples=1,
                            num_inference_steps=30, 
                            seed=42,
                            #neg_content_prompt="a rabbit",
                            #neg_content_scale=0.5,
                          )

images[0].save("result.png")
```

## Distributed Inference
On distributed setups, you can run inference across multiple GPUs with 🤗 Accelerate or PyTorch Distributed, which is useful for generating with multiple prompts in parallel, in case you have limited VRAM on each GPU. More information can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/training/distributed_inference#device-placement). Make sure you have installed diffusers from the source and the lastest accelerate.

```
max_memory = {0:"10GB", 1:"10GB"}
pipe = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(
    base_model_path,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    add_watermarker=False,
    device_map="balanced",
    max_memory=max_memory
)
```

## TODO
- Support in diffusers API, check our [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/7586).
- Support InstantID for face stylization once stars reach 1K.

## Acknowledgements
InstantStyle is developed by the InstantX team and is highly built on [IP-Adapter](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter), which has been unfairly compared by many other works. We at InstantStyle make IP-Adapter great again. Additionally, we acknowledge [Hu Ye](https://github.com/xiaohu2015) for his valuable discussion.
